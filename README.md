#AuroraView - SwiftUI Aurora & Stars Animation ðŸŒŒâœ¨#

AuroraView is a SwiftUI project that simulates a dynamic aurora borealis with a starry night sky. 
It combines multiple animated gradient layers and a particle system to create a smooth, immersive visual experience.

*Features*

	â€¢	Animated Aurora Layers
Multiple gradient layers with different amplitudes, frequencies, and speeds for a realistic aurora effect.

	â€¢	Dynamic Starry Sky
Randomly generated stars with twinkling animations to add depth to the night sky.

	â€¢	Fractal Noise (fBM)
Aurora waves are generated using fractional Brownian motion for natural, organic movement.

	â€¢	Advanced Visual Effects
 
	â€¢	Blur for smooth layers
 
	â€¢	Blend modes to overlay colors seamlessly
 
	â€¢	Linear and multi-layer gradients for richer visuals
